# Question

What is the difference between how instance methods/properties and class methods/properties are created? What is the difference between how they are used?

# Answer

Class methods belong to the class themselves using the static keyword. Instance properties belong to the specific instance, don't need to use a static keyword. Static methods and properties have to be accessed using the original class name.
